## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated blue (#29ABE2) for reliability and professionalism; appropriate for task management.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F8) to provide contrast and emphasize UI elements, allowing 3D effects to pop.
- Accent color: Complementary yellow-orange (#F9A825) for call-to-action buttons and important notifications.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headings, combined with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use of detailed, 3D icons to match the overall theme, each related to task types, priority, and status.
- Dashboard uses a grid-based layout with clearly defined sections for tasks, team updates, and profile information. Implement smooth transitions and 3D animations on user interactions, like task assignments and updates.
- Incorporate smooth transitions between pages and interactive 3D animations on UI elements to maintain a dynamic, attractive experience. Task cards use a subtle 3D hover effect to show depth.
